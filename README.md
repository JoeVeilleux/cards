# Cards: Web programs for card games

This project contains web artifacts (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to implement some simple
playing-card-based games. It demonstrates web concepts such as HTML page structure,
CSS styling, and Javascript code for active features such as manipulating on-page
artifacts including simple animation.

# Running
To run the application:

1. Install this project into a directory.

2. Using a web browser, open 'index.html'.

# TODO
This project is an early-work-in-progress. Planned future enhancements include:

* Put the project under 'git' control and push it to GitHub.

* Split up the application into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (currently
it's all in the HTML file).

* Enhance it to support "general" features which could be used by more than one
card game and "game-specific" features which implement the particular features of
each game.

* Implement additional games, such as Solitare, Blackjack, card-counting, etc.
